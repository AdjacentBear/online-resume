        Skills (list relevant skills or areas of expertise)
        Awards, certifications, or other achievements (list any relevant awards, certifications, or other accomplishments) -->

 <!-- Use appropriate HTML tags to format the content of each section, such as h1 for section headings and ul or ol for lists. -->

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Hi I'm Brandon
            I'm UX Multimedia Designer.<br />
            I enjoy being creative. Whether it's creating designs or playing
            drums, creativity drives me.<br />
            I'm continuously learning and improving my skills and knowledge to
            find or create the best solution for a specific problem.<br />
            I admire the approach of "designing for the user" and working
            together as a team, trusting one another as we work towards
            achieving a common goal.
        </p>
